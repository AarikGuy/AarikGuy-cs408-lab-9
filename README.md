# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

We had to make a collision ball game that is interactive and designed to have users 
control a ball to destroy other balls. The environment itself is filled 
with colorful bouncing balls that change color upon collision. 

## Directions

To check out the bouncing balls game, go ahead and clone the repository with: git clone https://github.com/AarikGuy/AarikGuy-cs408-lab-9.git

Then click on 'Show Preview' and give the game a try.
